## GamePlay

FreeFall is a game in which you are a rock, which has unfortunately fallen from it's previous resting place. 
The goal is to get as far as you can, with only 3 lives.
There may or may not be an ending. 

## Software / Hardware

FreeFall is written in the [Arduino](https://arduino.cc) variant of C++, and uses the [Arduino Mega 2560](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3) 
for its extra I/O pins and enlargened memory. 
I use the [LCDWIKI_GUI](https://github.com/lcdwiki/LCDWIKI_gui) core library and the [LCDWIKI_KBV](https://github.com/lcdwiki/LCDWIKI_kbv) hardware-specific library 
to write to the display. 
You can see how to make it yourself [here](/installation).
