# FreeFall
the software behind Freefall
FreeFall is a game where you are a falling rock, trying not to get smashed to smithereens by ledges, in wich you have three lives, after which you use up you die/startover. distance is measured, and saved to the eeprom as a long. this all goes on an arduino mega with a 3.5 inch screen interfacing with the back 36 pins and receiving power from the 3.3v pin. i am using the lcdwiki libraries lcdwiki_KBV and lcdwiki_GUI, as well as EEPROM and potentially others in the future.
