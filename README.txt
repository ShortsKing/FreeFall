The FreeFall Software

I, John, am currently in the process of making a game with the arduino programming language and some of the arduino boards, which i have named "FreeFall".

FreeFall is a game in which you are a rock which has fallen off a cliff, and the goal is not to get smashed to smithereens by the ledges. you have 
three lives, and three difficulties to choose from, as well as a score to keep you motivated and a high score using the eeprom so you know the highest score that 
has been achieved!

this project began as a private repository, with just me working on it, though by now it could be at any stage by now. who knows? it might be going viral now! if 
you are not viewing this on github, please go to github.com/ShortsKing/FreeFall to view the original code.

libraries used in this project were not made by me, though, and i do not want to draw credit to myself for them. please look in the ibrary folders for information 
on who created them.

i hope if you wish to make this yourself, you can, and if i dont by the time you read this, please remind me to add an .rtf document with a list of 
parts i used. thank you for any support you have given, and i hope you receive the same as anything you have given, wether it be in knowledge or in other help!
